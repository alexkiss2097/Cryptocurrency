# Cryptocurrency

Developed by: Adam Seevers, Alex Kiss & Inna Kravchunovska
Project Start: Sept. 29, 2017

Our project will be to create an android application that retrieves real-time values for multiple different Cryptocurrencies and displaying them in an easy to read format. To do this we will be utilizing available APIs to retrieve the financial data and creating sorting methods along with graphs to display the data in a visually appealing way. Some of the Cryptocurrency APIs that we are currently considering are: 

CryptoCompare, Cryptonator, CoinMarketCap, Coinigy, and BitcoinAverage

We plan on having as many cryptocurrencies as possible, this will be dependant on the API we choose to use. We will be aiming to incorporate at least 10 of the most popular cryptocurrencies, including:

Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Neo, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple, Monero, Dogecoin, Lisk,  and more.

Once we have the data imported, we will give the user the option to select which cryptocurrencies they would like to display (could be one or many). When the user confirms their selections of the available cryptocurrencies, they will see a scrollable view of data available to them. This includes how much the cryptocurrency is currently worth and what the past trend is (whether it is decreasing or increasing in value).
